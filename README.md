## Technical Indicators

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence - MACD (Lagging)

Many false positives on sideways market, to be used with others

Typical made by 3 periods:
- 12 Slow Moving Averga
- 26 Fast Moving Average
- 9 Signal

### Average True Rate & Bollinger Bands (Volatility)

Bollinger Bands made of N lines (2) from M periods (20) moving average line.
Delta is wide on high volatility & short during reduced volatility

ATR range perspective as swinging moves

### Relative Strenght Index - RSI

Momentum oscilation [0,100]
- [70,100] overbought (Emerging markets use 80)
- [0,30] oversold (Emerging markets use 80)

![TechnicalIndicators-RSI](img/TechnicalIndicators-RSI.png "TechnicalIndicators-RSI")

### Average Directional IndeX - ADX

Trend stength [0,100] comparing successive signal, then calculating the smoothed average of the difference of these
- [0,25]    abscent or weak
- [25,50]   strong
- [50,75]   very strong
- [75,100]  exteemely strong

### OBV (Leading)

Volume preceeding price movement. Higher OBV price increase, lower OBV price decrease.
False signals
Used with MACD

## Performance Measurements KPIs

### Compounded Annual Growth Rate - CAGR

Comparison of different trading strategies for asset or portfolio.
Does not reflect investment risk, use with volatility measure.

![KPIs-CAGR](img/KPIs-CAGR.png "KPIs-CAGR")

### Volatility Ratio

Standard deviation of the returns to capture variability of returns from the mean return. Annualization by multiplying volatility with aquare root of annualization factor:

- annualize daily volatility * sqrt(252) => 252 traiding days
- annualize weekly volatility * sqrrt(52) => 52 traiding weeks
- annualize monthly volatility * sqrt(12) => 12 traiding months

Used as risk measure assuming normal distribution of returns (false)
Does not capture tail risk.

### Sharpe Ratio

Average return earned in excess of the risk free rate per unit of volatility
Measure of risk adjusted return
Fails to dicern between upside and downside fluctuation
Used to compare funds
- [1,2] good
- [2,3] very good
- [3,more] excellent

![KPIs-SharpeRatio](img/KPIs-SharpeRatio.png "KPIs-SharpeRatio")

### Sortino Ratio

Similar to Sharpe Ratio but uses standard deviation of only negative returns.
Used to dicern between upside and downside fluctuation => consider harmful volatility

![KPIs-SortinoRatio](img/KPIs-SortinoRatio.png "KPIs-SortinoRatio")

### Maximum Drawdown Ratio

Largest percentage drop in asset price over a specified time period (peak distance difference)

### Calmar Ratio

Ratio of CAGR and Maximum Draw Down. Measure of risk adjusted return

## Strategies

First test your system/ strategy with a set of rules with trading signal mocking data with trading conditions
Factor in slippage (trading/ brokerage costs) when assessing performance.
Be conservative on side of caution

### Rebalancing - long term

Find a logical subset (L/ M/ S cap, industry, factor) specific and stick to this group.
Build fixed individual position sized long only portfolio by picking:
- M number of stocks based on monthly returns
- any other criteria

Rebalance every month replacing N worse stocks by top N stocks
Backtest it and compare the KPIs with that simple buy and hold strategy of corresponding index

### Intraday Resistance Breakout

Helps figure out when stock reach resistance (temporary historical top value - upper line)
Choose high volume, high activity stocks for this strategy (pre market movers, historically high volumes stocks)

Define breakout rule:
- use price breach 20 * period rolling max/ min price & vlume breaching rolling max volume (go long/ short stocks based on signals)

Define exit/ stop loss signal:
- use previous price +/- 20 * period ATR as the roling stop loss price

Calculate strategy cumulative return for each stock

### Intraday Renko Ratio - On Balance Volume

Pick high volume, high activity stock (pre market movers, historically high volumes stocks)

Define Buy Signal:
- Renko Ratio bar >= 2
- 5 day OBV Slope >= 30 degrees
- exit if Renko Ratio bar < 2

Define Sell Signal:
- Renko Ratio bar <= -2
- 5 day OBV Slope <= -30 degrees
- exit if Renko Ratio bar > -2

### Intraday Renko Ratio - MACD

Pick high volume, high activity stock (pre market movers, historically high volumes stocks)

Define Buy Signal:
- Renko Ratio bar >= 2
- MACD line >= signal line
- MACD line's slope (over 5 day period) >= signal line's slope (over the last 5 periods)
- exit if (MACD line < signal line) & (MACD line's slope < signal line's slope)

Define Sell Signal:
- Renko Ratio bar <= -2
- MACD line < signal line
- MACD line's slope (over 5 day period) < signal line's slope (over the last 5 periods)
- exit if (MACD line >= signal line) & (MACD line's slope >= signal line's slope)

## Value Investing - Fundamental Analysis

Price is what you pay, value is what you get.

Quantitative approach if you can afford computational power.
Quantitative methods:
- (Joel Greenblatt's) Magic Formula
- (Stanford Accounting Professor Joseph Piotroski) F-score

Excellent artcile on HFT based on actual events:

https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/magazine/flash-boys-michael-lewis.html

### Magic Formula

Best seller ''The little book that beats the market'':
- identify *wonderfull stocks* at *bargain price*

![FundamentalIndicators-ROIC](img/FundamentalIndicators-ROIC.png "FundamentalIndicators-ROIC")

*Wonderful stocks* : Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) focussing on assets generating the return

![FundamentalIndicators-EarningsYield](img/FundamentalIndicators-EarningsYield.png "FundamentalIndicators-EarningsYield")

*Bargain price*: Earning Yield is the ratio of EBIT to Enterprise Value (like P/E ratio but capital structure independent)

![FundamentalIndicators-MagicFormula](img/FundamentalIndicators-MagicFormula.png "FundamentalIndicators-MagicFormula")

Invest in the top 20-30 companies (exclude finance & insurance), accumulating 2-3 positions per month over 12 months period and rebalance each year.

### F-score (mid & small caps)

Number [0-9] which assess company's financial position strength, 9 bieng best. Pick sctock [8,9] and rebalance once or twice a year.

* profiltability criteria:
    - positive return on assets in the current year (1 point)
    - positive perating cash flow in the current year (1 point)
    - return on asset higher in the current year compared to previous year (1 point)
    - cash flow from operations divided by total assets greater than ROA in current year - Accruals - (1 point)
* leverage, liquidity & source of funds criteria:
    - lower ratio of long term debt in the current period, compared to previous - decreased leverage - (1 point)
    - higher current ratio this year compared to previous year, more liquidity (1 point)
    - no new shares were issued in the last year, lack of dilution (1 point)
* operating efficiency criteria:
    - higher gross margin compared to previous year (1 point)
    - higher asset turnover ratio compared to previous year (1 point)

### Application

Evolving area
Commercial product lexicon based therefore un accurate
Custom ML can be a product to sell
Challenges:
- label large volumes of news data accurately
- equities need industry specific classifiers
- streaming news expensive
